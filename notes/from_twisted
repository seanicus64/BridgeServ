21:43 <@runciter> seanicus: crochet
21:47 < seanicus> crochet will get two different async frameworks to coexist?

21:50 <@runciter> seanicus: it may not be necessary - depends on the async library used by the discord library
21:50 <@runciter> seanicus: what's the discord library?

21:53 < seanicus> runciter: I'm using this: https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py
21:53 < runciter> oh, it uses asyncio
21:54 < runciter> i guess we don't have docs for this
21:54 < runciter> seanicus: ok, twisted can run on top of asyncio
21:55 < runciter> https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.html
21:55 < runciter> `import asyncio; from twisted.internet import asyncioreactor; asyncioreactor.install(loop=asyncio.get_event_loop())`
21:55 < seanicus> no documentation at all, eh?
21:56 < runciter> seanicus: there are doc strings but no narrative docs or tutorials
21:56 < runciter> though i am writing a book with a chapter about this
21:56 < seanicus> Does that .install method replace the reactor with a get_event_loop?

23:28 < runciter> seanicus: no - asyncioreactor.install(asyncio_loop) installs a twisted Reactor that wraps asyncio_reactor, while 
get_event_loop() returns a default event loop

00:07 < Zectbumo> seanicus: probably. you need the two loops to run together in one loop

00:15 < Zectbumo> seanicus: choose a reactor and run the iterate() method

00:16 < njs> Zectbumo: no, don't do that, use asyncioreactor

00:17 < Zectbumo> njs: just was looking up the link :)
01:07 < seanicus> Zectbumo: thank you for the suggestion!  I will work on that solution tomorrow.  I have an implemention written in pure 
vanilla python + threading, which is utterly horrendous, and I'd really love to use the twisted framework
