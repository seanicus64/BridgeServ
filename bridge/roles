bridgeserv:
    handles translation from one channel to another
    handles translation from one user to another

for example the api will send a PRIVMSG to a channel
api.privmsg("sean_discord", "#discord_main", "Hello world!")
the api will send a json of that to the bridge, so the bridge receives
    {"command": "privmsg", "user": "sean_discord", "message": "Hello world!", "destination": "#discord_main"}
The bridge will then do a look-up and change a few of these around.  The message it sends to the network will be:
    sean_IRC PRIVMSG #IRC_main :Hello world!

UIDs:
    001 00000 - BridgeServ
    the rest will be for each bridged user
User handler:
    namedtuple
    (uid, nick, user, host, real)
    handle nick collisions
user[uid][nick] = "sean"
    check if uid is valid
    check if nick is valid or used
user[nick][realname] = "sean p"
    dynamically figure out if index is nick or uid


IRC network > Bridgeserv > API > client
Bridgeserv handles all the irc server stuff, communicating with other servers, enforcing bans, keeping track of users, channels, etc.  Ht also talks to the API

The API is a simple module for the client to communicate with bridgeserv

the client handles whatever stuff is specific to the foreign service.
