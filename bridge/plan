connect to IRC network through 6667
activate modules for other things
module:
    discord
    facebook
    skype
    etc, etc
    should I even do this?

API for IRC interface
    work for completely different IRCDs, even generic 1459
    import bridge
    service = bridge.service
    service.login(password)
    service.add_channel()
    service.add_user()
    service.send_priv()
    etc

    service.channels()
    for c in service.channels():
        print(c.users())
    for m in service.get_messages():
        (maybe it should get_messages() anyway?

    bridge should have ability to ban users from using reserved patterns in nicks
        i.e. (only users from bridge DISCORD 1 can use a nick ending in "_D")
